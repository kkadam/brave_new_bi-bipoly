Purpose:
1. Creates a corotating polytropic binary system in cylindrical coordinates.
2. Each star can have a core and envelope with different polytropic indices.
3. There can be a molecular weight jump between the core-envelope boundary.
4. The output can be used in hydrodynamics code as initial model.

Required:
1. Nothing except reasonable guesses of the boundaries A, B, C, D and E of the binary system.
   A = Outer edge of the primary
   B = Inner edge of the primary
   C = Inner edge of the secondary
   D = Inner/ outer core boundary for primary
   E =  Inner/ outer core boundary for secondary
   Specified in file init, starting second number, second line.
   
How to use:
1. For the very first run with given resolution, make sure that in main.F90, have_green_funcs = .false.
   This can be changed to .true. for later runs with the same resolutions for a faster runtime.
2. Do:
   >> make clean
   >> make
   >> ./scf
