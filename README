Purpose:
1. Creates a corotating bipolytropic binary system in cylindrical coordinates.
   This means that each star can have a core and envelope with different polytropic indices and
   there can be a molecular weight jump between the core-envelope boundary.
3. The output can be used in hydrodynamics code as initial model.

Required:
1. Nothing except reasonable guesses of the boundaries A, B, C, D and E of the binary system.
   A = Outer edge of the primary
   B = Inner edge of the primary
   C = Inner edge of the secondary
   D = Inner/ outer core boundary for primary
   E =  Inner/ outer core boundary for secondary
   Specified in file init, starting second number, second line.
2. Other needed parameters are specified in runscf.h file.
   
How to use:
1. For the very first run with given resolution, make sure that in main.F90, have_green_funcs = .false.
   This can be changed to .true. for later runs with the same resolutions for a faster runtime.
2. Do:
   >> make clean
   >> make
   >> ./scf
   
Note:
Code is also known as bi-bipolytrope or SCF code. The very first attempt at creating biplytropic binary 
had some issues with convergence. Patrick Motl provided me with a version of SCF with different Poisson 
solver, which works, hence the name.
