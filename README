Purpose:
1. Creates a corotating polytropic binary system in cylindrical coordinates.
2. Each star can have a core and envelope with different polytropic indices.
3. There can be a molecular weight jump between the core-envelope boundary.
4. The output can be used in hydrodynamics code as initial model.

Required:
1. Nothing except reasonable guesses of the boundaries A, B, C, D and E of the binary system.
   A = Outer edge of the primary
   B = Inner edge of the primary
   C = Inner edge of the secondary
   D = Inner/ outer core boundary for primary
   E =  Inner/ outer core boundary for secondary
